  <h2>The reasons for Zoos not being beneficial</h2>
  <p>Animals love food and us humans love food too.
    We also love our homes but for the animals, their homes are being destroyed in current times.
    Zoos pave the way for an excuse to force animals from their natural homes and take them inside a display box environment.
    The animals are used for human entertainment.
    These places care only about profit and not the negative effects it can cause.
    Zoos are a terrible idea because they destroy mental health of animals and aren’t good for the public to acknowledge.

<h2>Animal Mental Health</h2>
<p>Animals are not robots, they have feelings like us humans.
  Those negative feelings can impact the animals’ mental health.
  Imagine being kidnapped from your family and brought inside a prison box for entertainment purposes.
  It’s a cruel experience for anyone. That’s how the animals are experiencing.
  No freedom to explore, limited options to eat from.
  This abuse is deteriorating the mental health of those animals.

<h2>People should not go to Zoos</h2>
<p>Zoos are meant for entertainment not for the well being of animals.
  They push the idea that maintaining animals in the Zoos helps the animals from going to nonexistent. But it’s giving the opportunity for companies to continue to destroy and build for money gain.
  The parents who take their children to see animals in the Zoos are contributing towards the money that allows the Zoos to continue running their business.
